Hi there! My real name is *Sarmad Wahab*, but I prefer to go by **bin**. I'm a 16 year old C# developer weeb male living in New York. I do most of my work in web development. My specific areas of interest in development are .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. I also like a good haul of modern physics and astronomy. My main interests are anime and Japan.

I also know JavaScript and I'm still getting familiar Java and TypeScript. I still try to prefer C# in any situation.  You can view my personal web page at [https://bin.moe](), you can find some contact information there as well as links to other social media.

I'm also a very experinced C# programmer, though not the best, I still consider myself helpful to others when it comes to C#. Feel free to drop me any questions at anytime via Discord (bin#0160) or [email](mailto:hi@bin.moe). I'm ranked as a **regular** on the *r/csharp* Discord server, which shows my activity within the C# community.
