Hi there! My real name is *Sarmad Wahab*, but I prefer to go by **bin**. I'm a 16 year old C# developer weeb male living in New York. I do most of my work in web development. My specific areas of interest are .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. I also like a good haul of modern physics and astronomy. My main interest is anime and Japan.

I also know JavaScript and I'm still getting familiar Java and TypeScript. I still try to prefer C# in any situation.
